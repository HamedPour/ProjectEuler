### Project Euler 

## Fun
A bit of fun with with some C++, math and computational thinking.

Oh and when I say "fun" I actually mean getting through a few hundred A4 pages 
and raging at the ccp files.... 

## Further details
For further details on Project Euler go [Here](https://projecteuler.net/)
If you're feeling adventurous go ahead and try a few of the problems.
Just remember to solve them first on paper before you start to code.

Have "fun" :)
