### Project Euler 

## Fun
A bit of fun with with some C++, math and computational thinking.

Oh and when I say "fun" I actually mean getting through a few hundred A4 pages 
and raging at the ccp files.... 

## Further details
For further details on Project Euler go [Here](https://projecteuler.net/)
If you're feeling adventurous go ahead and try a few of the problems.
Just remember to solve them first on paper before you start to code.

Have "fun" :)


## Personal thoughts on solutions
1. The first problem was rather easy. It was all about using the modulus operator and a single for loop.
	I must however add the there are some very sophisticated solutions to it out there that are worth looking over.

2. This second problem took a few hours of thinking. The issue that I found difficult was trying to solve this problem
	using recursion. despite the fact that fib is much easier to code and understand using recursion it was not as simple
	when it came to suming even terms. In the end I used a while loop. Another interesting point was that f(n-1) was more 
	than enough to check to see if the term limit was reached since f(n-2) will always be behind it.
